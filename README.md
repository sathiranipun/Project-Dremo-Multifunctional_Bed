# Project-Dremo-Multifunctional_Bed
This is our 1st year Hardware Project. Using ATmega32A micro-controller we designed this. 16x2 lcd pannels,PIR Sensors,HX711 module,DHT11 Sensor,Loadcell,Gear Motors,Realay Modules,LDR Sensor we use for that. We used PCB which designed and made by us.  We all live in an era where the technology is developing day by day. So most of the people spending a very busy life style. They all have a complex tight time schedule for every day. So they are always spending a stressful life.  To reduce stress in our mind and discomfort in our body we want a comfortable and effective sleep. A comfortable sleep is very important to continue our day today work systematically  In Multi-functional Single Bed we use , 1. Alarm system 2. Floor light system 3. Movable study table and study lamp 4. Mosquito repellent system 5. Cooling system  As a solution to the above situations we have suggested to design a multi-functional bed. From this we provide people with comfortable sleep and a comfortable on time wake-up.
